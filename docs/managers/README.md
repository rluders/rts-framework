# Managers

Managers are specialized systems that handle specific gameplay mechanics. They are responsible for coordinating interactions, such as unit selection and command issuance.

- [SelectionManager](./selection_manager.md): Handles unit selection and deselection.
- [CommandManager](./command_manager.md): Issues commands to selected units (e.g., move, attack, build).
- [ConstructionManager](./construction_manager.md): Manages building construction logic.
- [FogOfWarManager](../features/vision/fog_of_war_manager.md): Manages what the player see of the map.
